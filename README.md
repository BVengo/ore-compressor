# Ore Compressor
This datapack will automatically compress ores and precious metals into their most condensed forms.

To enable compression, you must have a piece of paper in your inventory labelled 'compress'. This requirement has been included in an attempt to guarantee that items will only be condensed when you need them to be, and to minimise unnecessary function calls. Additionally, there must be an incomplete stack of the compressed item *or* an empty slot in your inventory to guarantee space for the items.

Please note that it will only compress the metals that have a reversible recipe. This means that nether quartz and amethyst shards won't be compressed.

## Automated Recipes
As defined by the vanilla minecraft recipes, all of the below compressions require you to have 9 of the original item in your inventory.
